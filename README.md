This project is special to me as it is the first project I was able to complete entirely on my own. THe boilerpalte HTML and CSS are from my coding course, however the Javascript is entirely my own.

I used a random number generaing code to give a number between 1 and 6. Then I used that number in if/elseif/else statements to set the parameters for images.

I then used if/esleif/else statements to use the DOM to change the words on the screen indicating who won.

I know that there are more concise ways of writing this code to achieve the same result, but as this is my first time writing code completely on my own, I want to leave it as is.
